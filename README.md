CFG Spreadsheet analysis project
----
This project, developed during my Python course with Code First Girls, 
involved collaborative work with Anoushka (@anoushkavail) and Lichia (@lichiareghu).
Our goal was to analyse a spreadsheet containing financial data related to sales. 
Using Python and Pandas, we performed data analysis and group operations. 
The Streamlit interface allowed us to visualise the results effectively.

INPUT: a file in the csv format

OUTPUT : a csv file containing the summary of the basic stats analysis for the file

TO RUN THE APP USE COMMAND:
> streamlit run app.py
